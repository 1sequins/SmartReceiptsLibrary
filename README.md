The following resources were used to develop this application:

- **[iTextPDF](http://itextpdf.com/).** The iTextPDF library was used to generate all PDF reports.
- **[ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/)**. The Action Bar Sherlock library provides cross-platfrom ActionBar support.
- **[AndroidCamera](https://github.com/wbaumann/AndroidCamera)**. This library is a modified version of the Camera & Galler3d applications, which were modified for Smart Receipts.
- **[WBMiniLibrary](https://github.com/wbaumann/WBMiniLibrary)**. This is a simple library project, which I built for storage, camera, and other utility functions.
